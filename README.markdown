# Introduction
The [dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) documentation browser doesn't have `async.js` documentation. So I created it using [JSDoc for Dash](https://github.com/nicholascloud/jsdoc3-dash). I should contribute this to the `dash` project but I'm lazy so I just place it here.

# How to use
`git clone` this repo and click *Manage Docsets* from the main page of `dash`. Click the `+` button at the bottom left corner of the window, choose `async.js.docset` from your file system. Done.
